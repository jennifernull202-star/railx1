Never hide important filters.
Always give smart defaults.

D) Listing photos MUST dominate the UI

Just like AutoTrader highlights the car image.

E) Minimal text, maximum clarity

Use bullet points instead of clutter.

12. EXACT PHRASES TO TELL GITHUB COPILOT

When you want Copilot to generate an AutoTrader-style section say:

“Build this exactly like AutoTrader’s vehicle results page but adapted to rail listings.”

or

“Generate an AutoTrader-style listing card UI for rail equipment.”

or

“Design a contractor directory with the same UX patterns as AutoTrader’s dealer locator.”

or

“Create a listing detail page modeled after AutoTrader’s vehicle page: gallery, price, seller panel, spec sheet, related items.”
